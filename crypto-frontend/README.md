Hello all,

This is my project 5 at General Assembly. I will be creating a full stack application. It will be tracking all cryptocurrencies, updating in real time, displaying the price, volume, market cap and 24HR change. 

I am using React for my front-end and Ruby on Rails for my backend. 

API is from: https://www.coingecko.com/en
